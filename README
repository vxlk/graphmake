TODO:
db editor widget
1. var selection
2. implement connections for nodes / vars
3. add stuff to db
4. make a find all function in the log
5. Make potential connections only display when it is a proper input/output connection

BUGS:
1. pin highlighting is not checked (input can go input etc)
2. highlighted pins linger after drawing a connection sometimes
3. lines for connected nodes do not line up to the actual node
4. names dont line up to nodes
5. CLOSE FILES IN XML

DEPENDS:
pyqt5 (pip install PyQt5)
