TODO:
1. create a ui to pick different node names
2. Make potential connections only display when it is a proper input/output connection

BUGS:
1. pin highlighting is not checked (input can go input etc)
2. highlighted pins linger after drawing a connection sometimes
3. lines for connected nodes do not line up to the actual node

DEPENDS:
pyqt5 (pip install PyQt5)
